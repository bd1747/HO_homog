https://askubuntu.com/questions/857528/python-3-cannot-import-third-party-packages
Solution:
My Python3 installation was looking into site-packages and ignoring dist-packages, so I added a path file to make it look inside dist-packages as well.
cd /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages
sudo vim dist-packages.pth
(Press i to go into insert mode inside Vim)
../dist-packages
:x (and Press Enter/Return)

The MeshValueCollection class can be used to store data associated with a subset of the entities of a mesh of a given topological dimension. It differs from the MeshFunction class in two ways. First, data does not need to be associated with all entities (only a subset). Second, data is associated with entities through the corresponding cell index and local entity number (relative to the cell), not by global entity index, which means that data may be stored robustly to file.
