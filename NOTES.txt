Solution:
My Python3 installation was looking into site-packages and ignoring dist-packages, so I added a path file to make it look inside dist-packages as well.
cd /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages
sudo vim dist-packages.pth
(Press i to go into insert mode inside Vim)
../dist-packages
:x (and Press Enter/Return)
